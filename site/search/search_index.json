A variable can contain any type of values, but when a variable has a memory address as its value, it's called a pointer. To create a pointer, an & operator is used to retrieve the memory address of a variable: var x = 101 // an integer as its value var ptr = &x // get the memory address of x and stores it in a variable called ptr The &x retrieves the memory address of x and stores it in ptr . A complete example: package main import \"fmt\" var p = fmt.Println func main() { var x = 101 var ptr = &x p(\"The memory address of x:\", &x) p(\"The memory address of ptr:\", &ptr) p(\"The value of ptr:\", ptr) } // output The memory address of x: 0xc0000b4020 The memory address of ptr: 0xc0000b6018 The value of ptr: 0xc0000b4020 Go Playground Every variable represents a memory address pointing to a value like so: 0xc0000b6018 = 101 A variable pointing to a memory address of another variable is called a pointer. Dereferencing a Pointer Dereferencing is used to access or manipulate data contained in a memory location pointed to by a pointer variable or simply pointer. To access or manipulate the data of a pointer or to dereference a pointer, an * operator is used in front of the pointer variable: package main import \"fmt\" var p = fmt.Println func main() { var x = \"Having fun with pointers\" // declare a varible with data of type string var ptr = &x // store the memory address of variable, hence a pointer p(*ptr) // print the value of the pointer *ptr = \"Still having fun with pointers\" // dereference the pointer with new data p(x) // print the new data } Go Playground https://dave.cheney.net/2017/04/26/understand-go-pointers-in-less-than-800-words-or-your-money-back https://medium.com/@Kabilan1290/journey-of-my-first-bug-bounty-72175d903ce3 https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/introduction-to-bug-bounty-for-noobs-46654bd6e0e2 https://hackingarise.com/xss-dorking/ https://craighays.com/bug-bounty-hunting-tips-6-simplify/ A Pointer as an Argument in a Function To define a function() that takes a memory address as an argument or simply a pointer, *T is used as the type. In this case, *int which stands for a pointer to an int, or a memory address whose value is an int. You give the function() a memory address by prepending the variable with an & operator. Inside the function, an * is used to access the value, hence dereferencing a pointer. package main import ( \"fmt\" ) func zero(ptr *int){ // *int means: i need a memory address that points to data of type int // behind the scene, ptr will point to a memory address that looks like this (in hexadecimal): ptr = 0xc00002c008 // on the next line, the asterisk '*' is used again(now in front of the pointer variable) // to dereference the pointer, hence access/manipulate the value stored in that particular // memory address // behind the scene => replace the value of 0xc00002c008 with 0 *ptr = 0 // store 0 in the memory address *ptr is refering to // if i write: ptr = 0 // the go compiler will return an error saying: cannot use 0 (type int) as type *int in assignment // because ptr is like: var ptr *int // ptr will only accept or store a memory address as its value // // you can't just assign a value in it // you have to dereference it first } func main() { x := 5 zero(&x) // the & operator finds the address of variable x fmt.Println(x) } Go Playground Slice A slice is a dynamic container that hold elements of the same type. It's build on top of an array. https://play.golang.org/p/GJrrw1BYo_O https://blog.golang.org/slices-intro https://medium.com/rungo/the-anatomy-of-slices-in-go-6450e3bb2b94 https://craighays.com/bug-bounty-hunting-tips-4-develop-a-process-and-follow-it/ Slice Literal A slice literal is used when you already know what values it will contain: package main import ( \"fmt\" ) func main() { s := []string{\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"} fmt.Println(s) } Two ways to create an empty or nil slice Initialize an empty slice with a nil value: var mySlice []int According to Golang Wiki , the former is the preferred way. Using the builtin make function to create an empty slice (non-nil): mySlice := make([]string, 0, 10) The syntax: make([]T, length, capacity) Full example: package main import ( \"fmt\" ) func main() { mySlice := make([]int, 5, 10) fmt.Printf(\"mySlice is of type %T\\nIts length is %v\\nIts capacity is %v\", mySlice, len(mySlice), cap(mySlice)) } Output: mySlice is of type []int Its length is 5 Its capacity is 10 To create a slice with a length or capacity, use make() Go Playground There's another shortcut: slice := []string{} The above slice is empty with a length of zero instead of nil(non-nil slice). Note: In most cases, empty slice and nil slice can be treated the same. In some cases, they should be treated differently, one of them is when doing JSON encoding. An empty slice will be encoded as an [] in JSON while nil slice will be encoded as null . for...range loop over a slice The recommended way to iterate over a slice is by using a for...range loop: package main import ( \"fmt\" ) func main() { mySlice := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} for i, v := range mySlice { fmt.Printf(\"Index %v has the value of %v\\n\", i, v) } } Go Playground Slicing a slice Slicing is used to access an individual or a slice of an array. Why a slice of an array? Because slices are built on top of arrays. If you change an array, the result will reflect in the slice. To use the slice operator, two indexes are required : where the slice should start, and where the slice should stop, but not including it. Slicing from index 0 to 4 : package main import \"fmt\" func main() { underlyingArray := [5]string{\"g\", \"o\", \"l\", \"a\", \"n\", \"g\"} slice := underlyingArray[0:4] fmt.Println(slice) } Output is: [g o l a] The second index is the index the slice will stop before. Slice from index 1 till the end package main import ( \"fmt\" \"os\" ) func main() { slice := os.Args[1:] for _, v := range slice { go doSomethingAmazing(v) } } Take a list of arguments from standard input and slice from index 1 till the end. Index 0 or the name of the Go script is discarded. Slice from index 0 till index 4 If you omit the start index, 0 will be used as default: package main import ( \"fmt\" \"os\" ) func main() { underlyingArray := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} slice := os.Args[:3] for i, v := range slice { fmt.Printf(\"Index %v has the value of %v.\", i, v) } } Output is: [1 2 3] Appending to a slice The built-in append function , appends element to the end of a slice. It is therefore necessary to store the result of append, often in the variable holding the slice itself. The anatomy of the append function : func append(slice []Type, elems ...Type) []Type It takes a slice as the first parameter, and the second parameter can be an unlimited number of elements of the same type or another slice(unfurled with an elipsis). And it returns a slice. That's why it's recommended to store the result in the slice that we're appending values to. Example: package main import ( \"fmt\" \"bufio\" \"os\" ) func main() { var slice []string // initialize a nil slice fmt.Println(slice) // slice is nil sc := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin) // take parameters from standard input for sc.Scan() { // loop over lines of input slice = append(slice, sc.Text()) // append each line to the slice } fmt.Println(slice) // results } Try it: echo -e \"1\\n2\\n3\\n4\" | go run main.go Passing Slices to a Variadic Function package main import ( \"fmt\" \"strings\" ) func main() { s := []string{\"Go\", \"is\", \"my\", \"favourite\", \"Programming\", \"Language\"} // creates a slice of string with 6 elements result := concatStrings(s...) // unfurl the slice with an elipsis and pass it to the function fmt.Println(result) // prints the result } func concatStrings(sentence ...string) string { var sum string for _, v := range sentence { sum += v + \" \" // concatenate all elements } sum = strings.TrimSpace(sum) // remove leading and trailing spaces return sum + \".\" // add a dot at the end } Go Playground The danger of appending to a slice that already has a length and a capacity package main import ( \"fmt\" ) func main() { numbers := []int{11, 12, 13} mySlice := make([]int, 5, 10) for _, v := range numbers{ mySlice = append(mySlice, v) } fmt.Println(mySlice) } Output: [0 0 0 0 0 11 12 13] One of the ways to make use of an empty slice: package main import ( \"fmt\" ) func main() { candidates := []string{\"macOS\", \"OpenBSD\", \"Linux\"} // number of votes votes := []string{\"macOS\", \"OpenBSD\", \"Linux\", \"macOS\", \"OpenBSD\", \"macOS\"} // make an empty slice with the length of the total number of candidates counts := make([]int, len(candidates)) for _, vote := range votes { matched := false for i, candidate := range candidates { if candidate == vote { counts[i]++ matched = true } } if matched == false { candidates = append(candidates, vote) counts = append(counts, 1) } } for i, candidate := range candidates { fmt.Printf(\"%s: %d\\n\", candidate, counts[i]) } } Go Playground Maps Structs https://pragmaticwebsecurity.com/cheatsheets.html Pointer in a struct https://medium.com/a-journey-with-go/go-should-i-use-a-pointer-instead-of-a-copy-of-my-struct-44b43b104963 https://medium.com/a-journey-with-go/archive https://goinbigdata.com/golang-pass-by-pointer-vs-pass-by-value/","title":"Golang"},{"location":"golang/#golang","text":"","title":"Golang"},{"location":"golang/#pointers","text":"A Pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.

It is tough to choose, but choose wisely. Poke a little bit on a target, find some low hanging fruit, understand the basic diffense the target is having. Get the feel for things on target. Do recon on the target, got subdomains now what?? -- it all depends now on the process that you want to follow or like: * You might only go for interesting names of subdomains and try to get some files. * You can find signup/registration adn login prompt subdomains and poke on these * Don't follow the complete process of others(hackers), make your own, take bit and pieces. Understand the target Learn how the developers are thinking, learn how the website is working. If the dev is missing something at one place, chances are that there will be some other places where they are missing the same. Understand what they are trying to protect, what they are trying to achieve. --> Never stop doing recon, websites are always bringing new code. --> XSS, open URL redirect, CSRF, clickjacking are low hanging fruits. --> Most apps are vulnerable to IDOR. Don't spray wild payloads everywhere, understand whats going on, make POC according to that. Try to understand what the website is actually about. There are som many bug class, so try to set your focus on what you what you want to find at the endpoint or in a website. If you find the key, google the key/token, check if there is some talk around it. Come up with your won checklists when testing ! Example: If you are abel to signup, you can interact, things to test for -stored xss, open redirect, can you upload photo, token leaks. Check what can you do? Look on burp, see interesting parameters. Example: This applies to XSS, open redirect - \\<h2> \\<h2 \\<%00h2> \\<%0dh2> \\</h2/x> Try to understand the filter, try to understand if their filter is vulnerable. Put beeceptor kind of url in referer and check if site reaches to you. Use spider to find endpoints and JS links. Read, Read and read ! Disclose reports, tutorials, writeups, Test for bypasses ! Try Changing content-type Find the IP to bypass cloudfare. Found something in X-Forwarded-For or Cookie header which is exploting XSS, you can use cache poisoning, try it, it might work. How do you know if endpoint is vulnerable to SSRF? --> check for parameters, if something is URL, or something that is looking as url ,even if the endpoint like \"/endpoint\", potentially making a request somewhere to something, if you put your URL there, your server ip, or you can even put open url redirect so for example there's a end point where it will take another endpoint and send a request to it internally and give you the contents and if you try to change it to external website it doesn't work and it can only be an endpoint. Now if you found a open URL redirect what about if you force the server to visit that does it follow the redirect, which might follow it to somehting internal which might follow you the response. Example of Session Managament Issue I had a website where I could only insert an image but link to my website, I bypassed their protection to link it to my website and on the login they were pretty secure I can go to my URL and find some endpoints and one of the enpoint was where my image was so after logging in I get to that endpoint where my image was and then that image page link to my URL in the images and in the referer was leaked the user's token. Use X-Forwarded-For with 127.0.0.1 or local IP when you do signup/login/password reset and see what happens.
